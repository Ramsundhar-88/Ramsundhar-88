### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a full-stack web developer passionate about building things that not only *work* — but *work beautifully and fast*.  
I specialize in creating smooth, scalable web applications with a strong love for the **MERN stack** and **Next.js**.

I approach backend development like solving a logic puzzle — designing APIs, managing databases, and integrating AI systems that make apps feel a little smarter than usual.  
While I’m not deep into DevOps (yet), I take pride in writing clean, secure, and reliable code that keeps everything running seamlessly.

Lately, I’ve been diving into **AI integrations**, connecting **LLMs**, APIs, and smart automation to give web apps a touch of intelligence.  

When I’m not debugging, you’ll probably find me reorganizing my codebase (again) or finding yet another way to optimize performance — because there’s *always* a better way.
